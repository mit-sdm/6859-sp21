## Abstract
A tradespace is a visual representation of a set of concepts, developed by making a range of design decision, in a space defined by two or more metrics. The **TRADESPACE UNIVERSE** is a web-based interactive tool to perform a tradespace analysis using a traditional web-browser, instead of installing desktop-based softwares.

## Application

### Build / Install / Run
The application was developed in browser-based web-application form and has been deployed on Github Pages, so no additional installation process is required. It has been made available for public use\* here: [TRADESPACE UNIVERSE](https://6859-sp21.github.io/final-project-sdm/).

### Features
The tool has been developed as a minimum viable product to gather user-feedback from students who study tradespace analysis as a part of their curriculum. The prioritized feature set includes:
- Build your tradespace
 - Wizard-based user-experience
 - User instructions at each step
 - User validation to ensure data coverage
- Explore tradespace
 - Filter concepts based on choice options
 - Get more details on concept
 - Customize axis labels & title for direct use in reports

#### Potential Improvements
- Multi-attribute tradespace analysis with custom utility calculation model
- Constraints input in build mode to filter infeasible concepts
- Enable range inputs for scores & prices, instead of fixed values
- Upload user data in csv format
- Download tradespace
